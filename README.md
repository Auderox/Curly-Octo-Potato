# The Curly-Octo-Potato Repository [^1]
**Auderox's bad word blacklist, all in plain text files for ease-of-use.**

> I originally created this list for my own personal use. It was for my Discord bot automod and Youtube blocked words list. 
I figured some people would find this helpful for their own word blacklists — particularly those in content creation and community management. 

Contributions are welcome; feel free to pull requests and talk in discussion. 
I don't really use Github, nor do I understand how it fully works, so... please be patient with me. ;~;
