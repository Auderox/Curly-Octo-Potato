* [ ] Add regex and / or an ability to detect evasive action (what's the proper term?). ‚ùï
  * Currently missing.
* [ ] Add more unsafe links to the list. 
  * Need to add more NSFW "booru" links (Gelbooru, Danbooru, Xbooru, etc).
    * ***Resource found: https://github.com/red-tails/list-of-boorus/tree/master***
      * [ ] Add this ressource to the data sources file. ‚ùï
  * Need to add 8kun and Kiwifarms. Similar sites, if found, should also be added.
  * List is currently lacking links pertaining to drawn NSFW (hentai, yiff, etc).
  * List is currently lacking in shock sites.
  * List would benefit from the addition of more known phishing links.
* [ ] Add more slurs pertaining to ableism and gender to the terms list. ‚ùï
 * Termlist is particularly lacking.
* [ ] Add offensive kaomoji to the symbols list. ‚ùî
  * Currently missing. 
* [ ] Remove non-offensive terms from the bad words list. ‚ùï
* [ ] Find a credible source for the bad links. ‚ùó
  * Could not find original source.
* [ ] Find a credible source for the bad symbols. ‚ùï
  * Unsure if this was properly implemented.
  * Should probably credit an article that explains the meaning of such symbols. 

### <ins>Symbol Key:</ins>
